# Tags

Introduction
Tags are labels that can be added to various parts of Hornbill that facilitate browsing and searching to make things easier to find. Currently Tags are only available in Document Manager for documents but will be used more widely in the future.

Use the Global Search facility at the top of your screen and select Tags from the drop down list to search for the docs you need.

## Tag Cloud

Visualize the tags in a Tag Cloud, click through on any tag to see the documents which have been tagged with specific tags

Users with the Docmanager Library User role will be able to add new tags from this view. For more information on the available Document Manager Roles, click here.

Switch the language to display the Tag cloud in the languages enabled on your instance

If different language versions of the tag have not been defined under Tag Management then the tags will be displayed in the default language
