# Collections
Collections in Hornbill Document Manager can help you organize and manage your organization’s documents. Collections are like folders, but in Document Manager, a document can belong to more than one collection. This allows you to organize your documents in whatever way works best for your organization, for example by business area, subject, or purpose. 

Users can filter to find documents quickly by typing in keywords that can be found either in the document’s title or the document’s description.
 



## Collection types
Collections can be either Manual (Documents are assigned to a collection by manually choosing Add to collection from the document properties) or Self Organizing (Documents are added to a collection based on server side rules such as Tags or Owner).

Note that Deleting a Collection will permanently remove it from the system. Please note that this operation is not reversible. Deleting a Collection does not delete the documents that have been published to the Collection.
